# AEMA

AEMA Imports LLC is a dynamic importing company based in San Francisco, USA, focusing on bringing high-quality sea fish, caviar, and Chinese garments to the American market. The company emphasizes sustainable and ethical sourcing practices, working closely with suppliers to ensure product quality and compliance with US import regulations. The database will focus on supplier management, inventory tracking, customs and compliance documentation, sales, and customer relationship management.

Given this project is based on a fictional company, we will create simulated data that mirrors the operations of a real importing business. This approach allows us to design a database that supports the company's operational needs, from sourcing to sales, while ensuring compliance and efficient inventory management.
